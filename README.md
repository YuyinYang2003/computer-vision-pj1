This is an implementation of two-layer mlp model without pytorch or tensorflow.

To train the model from scratch and test different parameters, delete line 153, 155 and 157 in file 'main.py', choose the best parameters by checking the graph in folder 'plot'.

To directly use the trained model, delete '#' in line 160 and 161 in file 'main.py' and define xtest.
